- Summary: Metabarcoding study of the fungal and bacterial diversity in soils from almond crops in Southern Spain managed under organic and conventional practices.

- Datasets: the filtered datasets with relative abundances per sample for all taxa are found in *phyloseq* objects in R [here](data/intermediate/). Raw sequence data is under BioProject [PRJNA884175](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA884175/).
